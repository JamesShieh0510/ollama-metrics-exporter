# Task Plan: Analyze and Improve 3D Network Topology Visualization

## Overview
This task involves analyzing and potentially improving the existing 3D network topology visualization implemented in topology-3d.html. The file shows a Three.js-based visualization of an Ollama cluster network with nodes and connections.

## Task Progress Checklist
- [ ] Analyze current functionality of topology-3d.html
- [ ] Identify key components and structure
- [ ] Review data fetching and metrics parsing logic
- [ ] Examine visualization elements (nodes, connections, labels)
- [ ] Evaluate performance and user experience
- [ ] Suggest improvements or modifications
- [ ] Implement any requested changes

## Analysis Steps
1. Examine the HTML structure and CSS styling
2. Review the Three.js scene setup and rendering
3. Analyze the data fetching and parsing logic
4. Study the node and edge visualization components
5. Evaluate the user interface elements and controls
